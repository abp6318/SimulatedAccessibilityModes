# Simulated Accessibility Modes

This is just a prototype/hack of a Chrome extension that enables developers to test with different accessibility barriers applied. If anyone has ideas for improving or expanding this, I'm open to it!

## How to add to Chrome

1. Download the repository as a `.zip` file
2. Unpack the `.zip` file on your computer
3. Navigate to the following URL in your Chrome browser: [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
4. Enabled "Developer mode" in the top right of this view
5. Click "Load unpacked" in the top left
6. Navigate to your unpacked copy of this repository from step 2 and select it
7. (Optional) The extension should now be in your browser, but you can pin it by clicking on the puzzle piece icon on the far right side of your URL bar in Chrome and "pinning" this extension
